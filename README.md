# Landing-Page
 The purpose of this project is to learn and practive responsive web design. This is a website in progress
 I'm making as part of the FreeCodeCamp certification for responsive web design.
 The website is a simple static site (just the frontend) for a nonexisting trash pickup bussiness.
 I'm using basic HTML and CSS to create a responsive website before moving on to use JavaScript.
