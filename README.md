# TRASHTRACKERS Landing-Page
 The purpose of this project is to learn and practive responsive web design. This is a website in progress
 I'm making as part of the FreeCodeCamp certification for responsive web design.
 The website is a simple static site (just the frontend) for a nonexisting trash pickup bussiness.
 I'm using basic HTML and CSS to create a responsive website before moving on to use JavaScript.

 # Notes
 Since this is a project that i'm doing with the requirements and tests to pass in FreeCodeCamp, some of the links would refer information within the static page that is yet not available or was not included in that page. I took some freedome in linking the About and Contact links on the nav-bar to the footer. 

 Some of the choices in the design are influenced by the test cases from the project like including a video and a form for an email address as well as the sticky header.
